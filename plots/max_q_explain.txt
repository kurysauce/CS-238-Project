Interpretation of the Plot
The plot shows the Mean Q-Value Trends Over Episodes based on the Q-table's values recorded at each episode:

Positive Mean Q-Values:

Positive trends indicate that the agent is learning to associate actions with rewards, resulting in higher Q-values.
Episodes with spikes (e.g., ~30 episodes onward) suggest significant improvements in the agent's understanding of the environment.
Negative Mean Q-Values:

Negative values reflect states where penalties are common (e.g., missing the ball or scoring poorly in Pong).
Early episodes show heavily negative values, likely due to the agent exploring the environment without sufficient knowledge (high epsilon during exploration).
Fluctuations:

Drops to negative values after spikes (e.g., around episodes 10 and 40) suggest that exploration (random actions) led to worse performance in those episodes.
Trend Smoothing:

The gradual convergence towards positive Q-values over time indicates that the agent is learning an optimal policy as episodes progress, but the learning may still be unstable due to high exploration or suboptimal hyperparameters.
