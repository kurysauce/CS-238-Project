Interpreting the Change in Mean Q-Value Over Episodes Plot
This graph illustrates how the mean Q-value changes from one episode to the next during the training process. Here's how to interpret the key trends:

Large Initial Changes:

At the beginning, the changes in Q-values are relatively large and fluctuate significantly (both positive and negative).
This is expected because the agent is exploring the environment (high epsilon in the epsilon-greedy strategy) and learning to associate actions with rewards.
Decreasing Magnitude of Changes:

As the training progresses, the magnitude of the changes decreases and stabilizes closer to zero.
This suggests that the agent is converging to a stable policy, with smaller adjustments being made to the Q-values.
Oscillations Around Zero:

In later episodes, the changes oscillate near zero, indicating fine-tuning of Q-values rather than dramatic updates.
This behavior aligns with the epsilon decay, where the agent increasingly exploits learned policies rather than exploring new ones.
Negative Changes:

Occasional negative changes reflect situations where the agent adjusts its policy to correct for suboptimal actions or rewards.
Key Takeaways for Your Paper:
Learning Stability:
Highlight that the agent starts with large Q-value adjustments and gradually stabilizes, reflecting successful convergence.
Early Exploration:
The large changes early on demonstrate the effect of exploration during high-epsilon episodes.
Convergence Phase:
Oscillations around zero in later episodes confirm that the agent has transitioned from exploration to exploitation, refining its policy incrementally.
